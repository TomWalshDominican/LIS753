                        Please note: due to high demand on Saturday mornings, we use a deli-style ticket system to admit the 
                        first wave of Saturday customers. We begin distributing these free tickets at 8 am on Saturday, so arrive 
                        early for first dibs at the sale!

                    <h2>FAQ</h2>
                    <h3>Where do the books and other items come from?</h3>
                    <p>
                        These are mostly donations from individuals, estates, and companies. We also sell items that the Palo Alto 
                        Library has removed from their shelves to make room for new purchases.
                    </p>
                    <h3>How much do items cost?</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the Main Room and Children's Room, prices are as marked. Many items in those rooms are available for $1 
                        or 50 cents each, but collectible items may be priced higher.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the Bargain Rooms (rooms K6 and K7), all adult hardbound books are $1 each, all adult paperbacks are 50 
                        cents each, and all children's books are 25 cents each. On Sunday, prices in the Bargain Rooms are half-off, 
                        plus you can save even more by purchasing grocery bags from us for $5 each and then filling the bags with books.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Are gift certificates available?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Yes, you can purchase gift certificates at the sale in $5 denominations.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Do you charge sales tax?</h3>
                    <p>
                        No!
                    </p>
                    <h3>How many items can I buy?</h3>
                    <p>
                        From 10 am to noon on Saturday, we strictly limit each customer to 12 items each. This keeps the crowd moving 
                        and ensures fairness. We do not enforce item limits beyond that timeframe unless crowds are still exceptionally
                        large.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After purchasing their initial 12 items, customers are welcome to return for more items during Saturday 
                        afternoon or on Sunday. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Do I need a ticket to enter?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Tickets are only required to guarantee early access to the sale on Saturday. On Saturdays, customers will 
                        initially be admitted in the order of their numbered tickets that are given out from 8 am to 11 am. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Are tickets free?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Yes!
                    </p>
                    <h3>Can I get tickets for other people?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Each person can take a maximum of 2 tickets.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Who gets the money raised from the sale?</h3>
                    <p>
                        100% of the money will support the Palo Alto Library.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Can I donate my own items to the sale?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Yes! Please bring your donations to the Main Room.
