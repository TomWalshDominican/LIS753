                        Note: due to extremely high demand on Saturday mornings, we use a deli-style ticket system to control entrance to the 
                        Main Room at that time. We begin distributing the tickets at 8 am on Saturday, so arrive early for first dibs!

                    <h3>Where do the books and other items come from?</h3>
                    <p>
                        These are mostly donations from individuals, estates, and companies. We also sell items that the Palo Alto 
                        Library has removed from their shelves to make room for new purchases.
                    </p>
                    <h3>How much do items cost?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Prices are as marked. Most items are between 25 cents and $1. Some collectible items may be priced higher. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the lowest prices, visit the Bargain Rooms. On Sundays, all items in the Bargain Rooms are available
                        for 50% of their marked prices. Plus you can save <em>even more</em> in the Bargain Rooms on Sunday by 
                        purchasing grocery bags from us for $5 each and then filling the bags with as many items as will fit.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Are gift certificates available?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Yes, you can purchase gift certificates at the sale in $5 denominations.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Do you charge sales tax?</h3>
                    <p>
                        No!
                    </p>
                    <h3>How many items can I buy?</h3>
                    <p>
                        From 10 am to noon on Saturday, we strictly limit each customer to 12 items each from each room. This keeps 
                        the crowd moving and ensures fairness. We do not enforce item limits beyond that timeframe unless crowds 
                        are still exceptionally large.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After purchasing their initial 12 items, customers are welcome to return for more items during Saturday 
                        afternoon or on Sunday. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Do I need a ticket to enter?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Tickets are only required to guarantee early access to the Main Room on Saturday. Many customers arrive
                        early to hunt for specific items, and the tickets help to manage that initial rush. Customers who arrive 
                        later in the day on Saturday may join the end of any remaining line to enter the Main Room.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You do not need a ticket to enter the Children's Rooms or Bargain Rooms. You do not need a ticket for anything on
                        Sunday.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Once I have a ticket, what do I do with it?</h3>
                    <p>
                        On Saturday morning, customers will gain entrance to the Main Room in the order of their ticket numbers. 
                        We will begin announcing ticket numbers for admission to the Main Room at 11 am on Saturday.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once you have your ticket on Saturday, you may leave the facility and come back later. However, if you 
                        are not present at the Main Room entrance area when your ticket number is called, you will lose your reserved 
                        place in line to enter the Main Room. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Are tickets free?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Yes!
                    </p>
                    <h3>Can I get tickets for other people?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Each person can take a maximum of 2 tickets.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Do you have any food or drinks?</h3>
                    <p>
                        No, but a coffee shop and several restaurants are in walking distance. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Who gets the money raised from the sale?</h3>
                    <p>
                        100% of the money will support the Palo Alto Library.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Can I donate my own items to the sale?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Yes! Please bring your donations to the Main Room.
