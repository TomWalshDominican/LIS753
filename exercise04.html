                History:
                <q>
                    Both in Gaelic and in old French it is cat, although sometimes taking the form of chater in the latter; 
                    the Gaelic designation of the European wild cat being cat fiadhaich. In Welsh and Cornish the name is cath. 
                    If Martial's cattae refer to this animal, the earliest Latin use of the name dates from the 1st century of 
                    our era. In the work of Palladius on agriculture, dating from about the year A.D. 350, reference is made to an 
                    animal called catus or cattus, as being useful in granaries for catching mice. This usage, coupled with the 
                    existence of a distinct term in Gaelic for the wild species, leaves little doubt that the word 'cat' properly 
                    denotes only the domesticated species.
