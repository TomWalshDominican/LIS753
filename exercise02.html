            Both in Gaelic and in old French it is cat, although sometimes taking the form of chater in the latter; 
            the Gaelic designation of the European wild cat being cat fiadhaich. In Welsh and Cornish the name is cath. 
            If Martial's cattae refer to this animal, the earliest Latin use of the name dates from the 1st century of our era. 
            In the work of Palladius on agriculture, dating from about the year A.D. 350, reference is made to an animal called 
            catus or cattus, as being useful in granaries for catching mice. This usage, coupled with the existence of a distinct 
            term in Gaelic for the wild species, leaves little doubt that the word “cat” properly denotes only the domesticated 
            species. -- Encyclopedia Britannica, 1911
